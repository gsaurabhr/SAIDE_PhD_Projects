  title: Strategies to modulate inhibitory control of actions and thoughts in humans
  description: >-
    In everyday life, we are faced with situations where we have to control what
    to do, what to say, and what we think. How are we able to stop
    unwanted/inappropriate actions, intrusive thoughts that bother us, and
    negative emotions which hinder our ability to perform daily tasks?
    Impairments in inhibitory control manifests as disorders such as Tourette's
    Syndrome (uncontrollable actions or tics), obsessive compulsive disorder and
    anxiety disorders. Using neurofeedback, behavioral, and non-invasive brain
    stimulation approaches we will explore ways in which the underlying brain
    networks can be modulated to have functional effects on controlling actions
    and thoughts.

    Development of Artificial Muscles and EEG/EMG-driven Sensitive Prosthetic
    Hand for Enhancing Manipulation Capability for Missing Limb
  description: >-
    This study focuses on the development of artificial muscles and an
    EEG/EMG-driven sensitive prosthetic hand aimed at enhancing manipulation
    capability for individuals with missing limbs. Traditional prosthetic hands
    often lack the dexterity and sensitivity required for intricate tasks.
    Through the integration of advanced TSA artificial muscle technology and a
    sophisticated EEG/EMG interface, our prosthetic hand offers improved
    functionality and intuitive control. The artificial muscles replicate the
    natural movements of human muscles, enhancing the hand's agility and
    responsiveness. Moreover, the EEG/EMG-driven interface allows for seamless
    interaction between the user's neural signals and the prosthetic hand,
    enabling precise and intuitive manipulation. In addition, touch sensors will
    be integrated with prosthetic hand for enhancing control for in-hand object
    manipulation. This innovative approach holds great promise in significantly
    improving the quality of life for individuals with limb loss by restoring
    natural-like hand functionality and enhancing their ability to perform daily
    tasks with ease and confidence.

  title: Whole-brain modeling for simulating TMS-EEG in neurodegenerative disorders
  description: >-
    In this project, the student will first build a computational model of the
    whole brain to simulate some experiments. These experiments can potentially
    help in detecting the onset of neurodegenerative diseases like dementia at
    very early stages. In the second part of the study, they will validate the
    models with actual experiments, and then generate a large experimental
    dataset.  Strong quantitative background with undergraduate training in
    physics, computer science, electrical engineering or other quantitative
    fields is required. Keen interest in applying physics to biological systems:
    MRI, electromagnetism, dynamical systems (thorough knowledge of one or more
    of these will be a plus point). Students looking for a career in academia
    are preferred (the PI will be able to provide best guidance and advice to
    such a student).  [More

    Driving behaviour and traffic flow modelling framework under connected and
    autonomous traffic environment in India
  description: >-
    An integrated framework of traffic flow and driver behavior models, at
    network level, using a hybrid (micro +macro) modelling approach will be
    developed. Traffic congestion will be modelled through macroscopic approach
    (continuum modelling of traffic flow) and driving behavior will be modelled
    through microscopic approach. Preliminary model development use data feed
    from driving simulator experiments, and later will be validated and will be
    refined using data feed from an instrumented vehicle. The instrumented
    vehicle i.e. OBU (On Board Unit) will be used to collect field data on
    driving behavior and driving patterns in different traffic environments that
    will be used to develop realistic models of driver behavior in heterogeneous
    and unorderly traffic conditions. AI techniques such as deep learning will
    be used to process data from these sensors in real-time. A fusion of
    microscopic traffic flow theories and machine learning algorithms will be
    used to learn the driving behavior parameters.

    AI based computational material development for carbon capture utilisation
    and sequestration (CCUS)
  description: >-
    The goal of our project is to enable and advance the emerging field of
    data-driven research  (broadly covering the use of  artificial intelligence
    (AI), machine learning (ML), data science,  informatics, as well as
    modelling and computational research) for the development of novel 
    carbon-capture materials and value-added products from CO2 in conjunction
    with the use of molecular simulations. The present work, therefore, aims to
    reduce the computational cost in the search and design of new materials and
    valorisation products by bypassing the computational intensive DFT
    calculations. The other objective of the problem is to design the complete
    pilot system using 1st principle-induced AI algorithms, which can be
    implemented in existing industries (viz. Methane reforming plants, Steel
    Plants, Biogas production units, etc.) with high carbon footprints thus
    making the process more environment friendly.

    Drought Monitoring under Anthropogenic activities using hybrid modeling
    approach
  description: >-
    Despite the large efforts from various national or International
    organizations for drought and water stress monitoring in India, the existing
    drought or water stress monitoring systems are unreliable in providing
    city-level water stress information and show significant differences in the
    actual drought conditions. The existing drought monitoring systems do not
    consider the human influence on the water system, which causes differences
    in the actual drought conditions. Therefore, there is an urgent need to
    include regional human activities in drought monitoring using the hybrid
    approach (hydrological modeling and machine learning).
